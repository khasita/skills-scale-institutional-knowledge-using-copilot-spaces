# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our project lifecycle flows through five key phases: **Initiation** (validate need, align stakeholders, define success metrics), **Planning** (create actionable backlog, identify dependencies, define timelines), **Execution** (build, test, review iteratively), **Release** (deploy with safety checks and monitoring), and **Retrospective** (capture learnings and drive improvements). This lifecycle is supported by core principles including customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of small increments, clear role ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety to encourage feedback and learning.

Our delivery workflow uses a project board with six stages: **Backlog** (prioritized work items), **Ready** (refined items with clear acceptance criteria), **In Progress** (active development), **In Review** (code review and feedback), **QA** (quality validation), and **Done** (accepted and merged). Pull requests follow strict standards: keep changes small (â‰¤400 lines when possible), link to issues with acceptance criteria, run automated tests and security scans in CI before requesting review, and obtain at least one approval before merging. Our CI pipeline enforces unit tests, integration tests, security scanning, and linting to maintain code quality and catch issues early.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined across the team. **Project Managers** coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks, facilitate meetings, and ensure transparent communication across stakeholders. **Product Managers** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, validate solutions, and measure success against customer value. **Developers** implement features to meet acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in design reviews, and help identify technical risks. **QA/Testing** validates quality through multiple layers: unit tests for new logic, integration tests for component interactions, end-to-end tests for critical flows, automated security scans in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed.

Communication follows a regular cadence to maintain alignment and momentum. Teams hold **daily standups** (15 minutes, focused on progress and blockers), **weekly delivery syncs** (progress updates, demos, and risk review), and **demos/reviews** at sprint or milestone completion. Project Managers and Product Managers align weekly, while stakeholders receive regular updates (weekly or milestone-based). Before any release, teams complete pre-deployment checks: all CI tests passing, release notes drafted, rollback plan documented, and smoke tests prepared. This multi-layered approach to quality assurance, communication, and process ensures that OctoAcme delivers reliable software while enabling new team members to quickly understand and contribute to our project management practices.
